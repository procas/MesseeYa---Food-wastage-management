# MesseeYa---Food-wastage-management

With a view to increasing food wastage, this project was made as a means to manage excess food from in hostels, messes, canteens and other food outlets by connecting mess owners with nearby potential customers who are looking
for a quick grab of meal without being too concerned about what's on the menu. This way, there could be a way to reduce how much food got left over after being shared across all potentail customers.
It uses XAMPP engine to handle the DB hosting, PHP to handle client login and registration requests, in the frontend it makes use of HTML, CSS and Javascript for building the website.
