<h1>Who are we?</h1>
<p>We are everyone who walks on the streets everyday and look with pity on the ones living
by the roads, covered in dust and hunger, and wish in our minds that we were able to help them
in some or the other way, but are at a loss as to where to start. We are everyone who
makes it a point to contribute a part of our income to the destitute, however broke we may be,
and are looking for ways to be more involved still in eradicating world poverty. We are everyone 
that are willing to go out of our way to help those who are less privileged than we are.
We are the <b>The MesseeYa</b>.</p>

<p>Food is what a human being lives by. It is not less a basic need that air or water to sustain 
life. It is said that over 80% of India's and over 60% of the world's population is liable 
to be called 'poor' and 'food deficient'. They are deprived of not only life's luxuries but of
something without which life form itself would cease to exist-food. And this very food is being wasted in
several places, such as messes, hotels and restaurants as well as few minor dhaba's. 
The people who waste food do not realise that the food that even as they pour food down the drain
someone, somewhere, unable to afford food, dies of starvation.</p>

<p>According to a recent survey in a particular mess Chennai, the following are the rates of wastage:

The world food wastage is to the tune of several millions of pounds of food on a monthly basis,
which, if evenly and wisely distributed instead of being wasted, has the potential to feed over 
50% of the BPL population.</p>

<h1>Our vision</h1>
<p>While we cannot expect to be the answer to the world poverty and wastage, we do 
certainly wish to be a part of the revolution against it. Because we believe that every
action counts, however small. </p>
